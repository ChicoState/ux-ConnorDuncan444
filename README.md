# Connor Duncan's UX Journal
Hi, I'm a computer science major here at Chico State. My hobbies include video games, music production, and worldbuilding for my Dungeons & Dragons game. I would consider myself to be pretty introverted, but I tend to be pretty active in class discussions. I'm looking forward to an interesting semester.
Here is a photo of Chico State I got online
